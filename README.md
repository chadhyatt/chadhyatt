I'm Chad, security researcher and programmer by day, AND also by night thanks to caffeine :smiley:. I also maintain various open-source tools & libraries, and every now and then, a neuron or two activate in my brain and I occasionally build cool stuff.

If you enjoy or find any of my work useful and would like to donate (thank you!), I have [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/chadhyatt) and,

Every bit helps me be able to spend more time working on and contributing to open-source projects, and work on new projects too.
